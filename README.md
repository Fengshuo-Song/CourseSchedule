# CourseSchedule
## Data Folder:
all_data: dataframe after removing "@" rows and unnecessary columns\
all_data_full: full dataframe \
subject_names: list of all 3-letter subject code

## What To Do Next
1. Obtain a list of all course names using the link https://ucdavis.pubs.curricunet.com/Catalog/aas-courses-sc, where "aas" can be replaced by other subject code.
2. Split the course location column in both dataframe.
